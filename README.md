Your more proactive and understanding copilots.

Welcome to Pupa, an open-source project designed to revolutionize the way you browse and work. In this era of information overload, Pupa emerges as not just an application, but as a proactive and intelligent companion aimed at providing you with a more personalized and anticipatory form of assistance.

## Core Philosophy
The essence of Pupa is to create a novel form of interaction that proactively offers help based on the content you're currently viewing. Instead of waiting for you to ask questions, Pupa anticipates your needs, offering information, suggestions, or solutions like a friend who truly understands you.

## Key Features
Proactive Assistance: Pupa recognizes your browsing content and working habits to proactively offer suggestions and information.
Customization: Install specific “apps” to tailor the type of assistance PUPA provides, ensuring you receive the most relevant and useful support.
Community-Driven: Pupa encourages community members to develop and share new “apps”, continuously enriching and enhancing the platform.

## Join Us
Pupa is in its early stages, and we are eagerly seeking developers, designers, and anyone interested in innovative interaction models to join us. Whether providing feedback, contributing code, or sharing your “apps”, we welcome your participation.

Explore Pupa, experience a Copilot that understands you better, and embark on a journey of efficient work and learning.


Together, let's create a more proactive and understanding digital world.
